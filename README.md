# firebase

This application includes a range of Firebase operations designed to assist you. Below, I will provide a detailed explanation of each screen.

When you run the main.dart file, you will see three buttons. The first button, 'To Ecommerce App,' navigates to the E-commerce application, which I will explain later. The second button, 'To My-Notes App,' takes you to the Notes application, where you can create, delete, and update your notes. All data will be stored in Firebase. The third button, 'Add, Delete, Search Operations,' provides access to basic Firebase functions

When you click the 'To Ecommerce App' button, the screen will open, displaying data retrieved from Firebase.

You can scroll down to view all the different products fetched from Firebase. Click on any product to see more details. To add a product to your cart, simply click the 'Add to Cart' button.

Clicking the second button in main.dart will take you to the My-Notes application, where you can view the notes that have already been created and stored in Firebase, displayed on the screen.
